### **MongoDB**

MongoDB: is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. MongoDB is written in C++. MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented database that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB works on concept of collection and document.

### **ExpressJS**

ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends. With ExpressJS, you need not worry about low level protocols, processes, etc.Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications. It provides us the tools that are required to build our app. It is flexible as there are numerous modules available on npm, which can be directly plugged into Express.

### **ReactJS**

ReactJS is a simple, feature rich, component based JavaScript UI library. It can be used to develop small applications as well as big, complex applications. ReactJS provides minimal and solid feature set to kick-start a web application. React community compliments React library by providing large set of ready-made components to develop web application in a record time. React community also provides advanced concept like state management, routing, etc., on top of the React library.


### **Node.js**


Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.
Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.


### **Database Management System**

**DBMS** is a collection of programs used for managing data and simultaneously it supports different types of users to create, manage, retrieve, update and store information.

### **Types of DBMS**

The types of DBMS based on data model are as follows −

Relational database.

Object oriented database.

Hierarchical database.

Network database.

#### **Relation Database**
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a system where data is organized in two-dimensional tables using rows and columns.This is one of the most popular data models which is used in industries. It is based on SQL.Every table in a database has a key field which uniquely identifies each record.This type of system is the most widely used DBMS.Relational database management system software is available for personal computers, workstation and large mainframe systems.For example − Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server etc.


#### **Object Oriented Database**
It is a system where information or data is represented in the form of objects which is used in object-oriented programming.

1) It is a combination of relational database concepts and object-oriented principles.

2) Relational database concepts are concurrency control, transactions, etc.

3) OOPs principles are data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

4) It requires less code and is easy to maintain.

For example − Object DB software.

#### **Hierarchical Database**
It is a system where the data elements have a one to many relationship (1: N). Here data is organized like a tree which is similar to a folder structure in your computer system.

1) The hierarchy starts from the root node, connecting all the child nodes to the parent node.

2) It is used in industry on mainframe platforms.

For example− IMS(IBM), Windows registry (Microsoft).

#### **Network database**
A Network database management system is a system where the data elements maintain one to one relationship (1: 1) or many to many relationship (N: N).

It also has a hierarchical structure, but the data is organized like a graph and it is allowed to have more than one parent for one child record.

**Difference Between NoSQL and Relational Database Systems**


#### **Relational Database**


It is used to handle data coming in low velocity.

It gives only read scalability.

It manages structured data

Data arrives from one or few locations.

It supports complex transactions

It has single point of failure

It handles data in less volume

Transactions written in one location

Its difficult to make changes in database once it is defined


#### **NoSQL**

It is used to handle data coming in high velocity

It gives both read and write scalability.

It manages all type of data.

Data arrives from many locations.

It supports simple transactions.

No single point of failure.

It handles data in high volume.

Transactions written in many locations.

Enables easy and frequent changes to database.
